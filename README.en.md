# Codex-Skin-Store

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

Codex-Skin-Store is the public theme catalog for Codex-Skin. Browse themes on the web, download them manually, or send a signed theme to the Windows or macOS client with one click.

The storefront currently publishes Dilraba Star, ENFP Pop, Jackson Sage, and KUN Stage. Every card uses the real client theme preview rather than an interoperability mockup.

> This is a community project, not an OpenAI or official Codex product. The website cannot read Codex credentials, API keys, projects, tasks, or conversations.

## Get Started

1. Install the Codex-Skin client for your system.
2. Open Codex-Skin once so the operating system registers its import handler.
3. Visit the storefront and select a theme.
4. Choose one-click import.
5. Review the source, version, and exact size in the client.
6. After verification, decide whether to restart Codex and apply the theme.

Use `Codex-Skin-Setup-win-x64.exe` on Windows. On macOS, use `Codex-Skin-osx-arm64.pkg` for Apple Silicon or `Codex-Skin-osx-x64.pkg` for Intel. The current packages are unsigned and not notarized, so Windows SmartScreen or macOS Gatekeeper may ask for explicit approval.

## One-Click Import

Windows is distributed only as `Codex-Skin-Setup-win-x64.exe`. Setup registers `dreamskin://` and `.dreamskin` automatically; portable EXE and ZIP downloads are not published.

The macOS PKG declares the same URL scheme and document type. Open `Codex-Skin.app` once after installation so LaunchServices can finish registration.

The web page only starts a request. The client asks before downloading, verifies the exact size, SHA-256, Ed25519 signature, closed manifest, platform support, and image files, installs atomically, then asks separately before applying. A click can never silently install or activate a theme.

If Codex-Skin is already running, one-click import activates that window and performs confirmation and progress there. A new window is created only when no client instance is running.

## Faster GitHub Downloads

If GitHub Releases are slow, prepend a mirror to the original address:

```text
https://github.com/lixiaobaivv/Codex-Skin/releases/latest/download/Codex-Skin-Setup-win-x64.exe
https://ghfast.top/https://github.com/lixiaobaivv/Codex-Skin/releases/latest/download/Codex-Skin-Setup-win-x64.exe
https://gh-proxy.com/https://github.com/lixiaobaivv/Codex-Skin/releases/latest/download/Codex-Skin-Setup-win-x64.exe
```

Mirrors are third-party services and may be unavailable or return stale content. Verify installer downloads against `Codex-Skin-installers-SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same Release. For one-click theme imports, the client shows progress and safely retries the selected transport, direct GitHub, and built-in mirrors; exact size, SHA-256, and Ed25519 checks still apply to every result.

Desktop catalog sync uses the same fallback policy. It starts with the last transport that actually succeeded or the user's selection, tries direct GitHub and the remaining built-in mirrors when needed, then saves the successfully validated transport for the next launch.

## What Themes Can Change

Themes may change backgrounds, fixed sidebar styling, the masthead, logo, home guidance, four prompt cards, message bubbles, composer styling, and an optional pet image.

Themes cannot replace user projects, tasks, progress, conversations, account data, or Codex behavior. Prompt cards only insert their configured text into the real Codex composer.

## Troubleshooting

**One-click import does nothing:** open Codex-Skin once; repair Windows Setup registration; on macOS, confirm that you installed the latest PKG.

**Signature or hash validation fails:** do not continue. Download the theme again from the store and report the theme name, version, and client error code if it still fails.

**An imported theme was not applied:** installation and application are intentionally separate confirmations. Select the verified theme in Codex-Skin and choose **Apply and restart Codex**.

## Privacy And Safety

- The storefront is static GitHub Pages and requires no account.
- It does not probe the local client or connect to local CDP.
- Theme packages cannot contain JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SVG, shell scripts, executables, symlinks, or undeclared files.
- The desktop client is the final verification and consent boundary.

## Create And Submit A Theme

Anyone can submit a theme through a GitHub Pull Request; the official signing key is not required. See the [theme submission guide](docs/theme-submission.md) for every field and file location.

1. Fork this repository and copy an existing manifest from `themes/`.
2. Add the real preview, background, logo, and optional pet images to their matching directories.
3. Register the manifest in `theme-repository.json` and add a storefront draft under `catalog/themes/` with `package: null`.
4. Put the same real preview PNG in `public/theme-previews/`.
5. Run `npm ci`, `npm run catalog:generate`, `npm run catalog:check`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test`.
6. Open a PR with asset sources, redistribution licenses, and tested platforms.

After CI and maintainer review pass, maintainers create the officially signed `.dreamskin`, publish it to an immutable GitHub Release, and complete both catalogs. The approved theme then becomes searchable and previewable in both the website and Windows/macOS clients, with one-click import and manual download. Drafts are not published.

Storefront and catalog issues belong in [Codex-Skin-Store Issues](https://github.com/lixiaobaivv/Codex-Skin-Store/issues). Build and contribution details remain in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md); normal users do not need Node.js or a source checkout.
